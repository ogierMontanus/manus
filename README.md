## UPDATE

Caution: 

when updating to new TP versions make sure to port custom changes in `modules/lib/pages.xql` and `modules/lib/navigation.xql` which handle distribution of different layers into two-column system. This is connected to JS `extractTemplates` snippet in the `twocolumn.html` layout template.
